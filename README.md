Extracting group averages and reaction times from experimental data

1) Iterate over raw data files for each subject
2) load excel file for subject
3) count how many "picked_match" there are
4) calculate the sum of the reaction time (RT) for "picked_match"
5) add to group sum
6) caluculate avergae RT (in seconds) for each group (subjects and controls)
7) For each group, print sum of "picked_match" and the average group RT
